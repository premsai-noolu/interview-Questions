1. What is the difference between an AWS Region and an Availability Zone (AZ), and how do they work together?

What it means:

In AWS, each Region is divided into multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
These AZs are like separate data centers within the same region.

Key Point 1: AZs are connected with fast networks

AWS connects all AZs inside a region using low-latency, high-throughput networks.

Low-latency → Data travels very fast between AZs.

High-throughput → Large amounts of data can be transferred quickly.

This means your applications can communicate between AZs almost instantly.

Key Point 2: Deploying across multiple AZs increases reliability

If you deploy your application/resources in only one AZ, and that AZ goes down (power issue, network failure, etc.), your application becomes unavailable.

But if you deploy across multiple AZs, then:

If AZ-1 fails → AZ-2 will continue running.

Your application stays available.

Users don’t face downtime.

This is called high availability and fault tolerance.

Example:

Suppose you deploy:

EC2 instance in AZ-A

Another EC2 instance in AZ-B

Load balancer distributes traffic to both

If AZ-A fails:

Load balancer automatically sends traffic to the instance in AZ-B

Your application continues running without interruption

In simple words:

AZs are separate, but connected very fast.
Placing your resources in multiple AZs protects your application from failures and ensures it stays online even if one AZ goes down.

2. AWS Shared Responsibility Model – Explained Simply

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines what AWS is responsible for and what the customer is responsible for when using cloud services.

1️⃣ AWS Responsibility – “Security of the Cloud”

AWS protects the entire cloud environment, including:

Physical data centers

Hardware (servers, storage, networking)

Global infrastructure

Virtualization layers

AWS managed services security

This means AWS ensures the cloud platform itself is secure.

2️⃣ Customer Responsibility – “Security in the Cloud”

Customers must secure everything they build inside the cloud, including:

Data stored in AWS

User access and identity (IAM)

Application-level security

Operating system updates (for EC2)

Network configuration (security groups, NACLs)

Encryption settings

This means customers secure what they run on AWS.

How Responsibilities Change Based on Service Type
📌 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Example: EC2, EBS, VPC

Customer manages:

OS patches and updates

Security configurations

Applications

Data

Network rules

➡️ More responsibility for the customer.

📌 PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Example: RDS, Elastic Beanstalk

AWS manages:

Platform

OS

Database engine

Infrastructure

Customer manages:

Data

Access control

Application logic

➡️ Responsibility is shared more equally.

📌 SaaS / Serverless

Example: Lambda, DynamoDB, S3

AWS manages:

Infrastructure

Runtime

OS

Scaling

Customer manages:

Code

Data

IAM permissions

➡️ Minimum responsibility for the customer.

Simple Summary

AWS secures the cloud.

Customers secure their applications and data inside the cloud.

3. What is an EC2 instance?

An EC2 instance is a virtual server hosted in AWS that provides scalable compute capacity.
You can choose your own:

Operating system
Storage
CPU and memory configuration
Networking
Software stack

It behaves like a normal server but runs in the cloud and can scale up or down anytime.

Factors to Consider When Choosing an EC2 Instance Type

When selecting an EC2 instance type, you choose based on workload requirements. The main factors include:

1️⃣ CPU / Compute Requirements

If your application needs high processing power (e.g., batch processing, video encoding), choose:

Compute-optimized instances (C family)

If workloads are light or variable, choose:

Burstable instances (T family) → These earn CPU credits and handle occasional spikes.

2️⃣ Memory Requirements

If your application requires large amounts of RAM (e.g., in-memory caching, big databases), choose:

Memory-optimized instances (R, X family)

3️⃣ Storage Type and Performance

If you need fast disk I/O (e.g., databases, analytics):

Choose storage-optimized instances (I, D family)

Or select EBS-optimized options for faster disk performance.

4️⃣ Network Performance

For applications that need high throughput or low latency (e.g., load balancers, data streaming):

Choose instances with enhanced networking or higher network bandwidth.

5️⃣ Workload Pattern (Steady vs. Variable)

Burstable (T-series) → Good for low/medium workloads with occasional spikes.

Fixed/high-performance (C, M, R families) → Best for steady, predictable workloads.

6️⃣ Pricing Model

Pick based on cost and flexibility:

On-Demand:

No commitment
Pay-as-you-go
Best for short-term or unpredictable workloads

Reserved Instances / Savings Plans:

Commit for 1 or 3 years
Up to 72% cost savings
Best for long-term, steady workloads

Spot Instances:

Lowest cost
Can be interrupted anytime
Best for batch jobs or fault-tolerant workloads

---

4. ✅ What is Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a fully managed object storage service used to store any amount of data—from a few bytes to petabytes.
You can use S3 for:

Backups

Archives

Data lakes

Big data analytics

Log storage

Hosting static websites

Storing images, videos, files, etc.

S3 stores data as objects inside buckets (similar to folders).

✅ Durability vs Availability (Very Important in Interviews)

S3 provides two strong guarantees:

1️⃣ Durability – “Your data will not be lost.”

S3 offers 11 nines durability, written as:

99.999999999% durability (11 nines)

This means:

AWS almost guarantees your data will never be lost.

Even if a disk fails or a server crashes, your data is safe.

How S3 achieves durability:

Automatically replicates your object across multiple AZs (Availability Zones)

Constantly monitors and repairs data

Performs checksum validations

Even if one AZ completely fails, your data remains safe in another.

2️⃣ Availability – “You can access your data when you need it.”

S3 Standard provides ~99.99% availability.

This means:

You may face downtime for only a few minutes per year.

This ensures your data is accessible almost all the time.

Different S3 storage classes offer different availability:

S3 Standard: 99.99%

S3 Standard-IA: 99.9%

S3 One Zone-IA: 99.5%

Glacier: Lower availability (retrieval takes minutes to hours)

🧠 Simple Example to Understand Durability vs Availability

Imagine storing your important files in three different lockers across three buildings:

✔ Durability
Even if one building catches fire, your files still exist in the other buildings → data is safe.

✔ Availability
If one building is temporarily closed, you can still access your files from other buildings → data is accessible.

5. ✅ What is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?

A VPC is your own private network inside AWS.
It behaves like a traditional on-premises network but runs in the AWS cloud.

With a VPC, you control:

Your IP address ranges
Subnets
Routing
Internet access
Security rules

It gives complete control over how your AWS resources communicate inside and outside AWS.

✅ Why do we use a VPC? (Purpose)

A VPC lets you:

Isolate your workloads
Secure your applications
Control incoming/outgoing traffic
Create public and private environments
Connect to on-premises networks

In simple words → VPC = Your own secure network inside AWS.

✅ Core Components of a VPC (Explained Simply)

Below are the most important parts:

1️⃣ Subnets – Divide your VPC

A subnet is a small section inside your VPC.

There are two types:

Public subnet:

Has internet access

Used for EC2, ALB, Bastion, etc.

Private subnet:

No direct internet access

Used for databases, backend servers

2️⃣ Route Tables – Define where traffic goes

A route table tells the network where to send traffic.

Examples:

Route internet traffic to Internet Gateway

Route private traffic to NAT Gateway

Route internal traffic inside VPC

Think of it as Google Maps for your VPC: it tells packets which path to take.

3️⃣ Internet Gateway (IGW) – Enables public internet access

Attached to the VPC to give public subnets:

Inbound access from internet

Outbound access to internet

Without IGW → no internet.

4️⃣ NAT Gateway – Internet for private subnets

Private subnets cannot directly access the internet.

So NAT Gateway allows:

Outbound internet access (for patching, updates)

But blocks inbound traffic

Used mainly for backend servers and databases.

5️⃣ Security Groups (SG) – Instance-level firewall

Stateful
(If you allow inbound, outbound is automatically allowed)

Applied to EC2, RDS, etc.

Controls what traffic can reach an instance.

Example:

Allow port 80 from anywhere
Allow SSH only from your IP

6️⃣ Network ACLs (NACLs) – Subnet-level firewall

Stateless
(Inbound and outbound rules must be added separately)

Acts as a second layer of security

Controls traffic for entire subnets

Example:

Allow all internal traffic

Deny dangerous ports

7️⃣ Additional Components (optional but common)

VPC Peering: Connect two VPCs
VPN / Direct Connect: Connect AWS VPC to on-prem network
Elastic IP (EIP): Static public IP

⭐ In One Line:

A VPC is a private, secure, customizable network inside AWS containing subnets, route tables, gateways, and firewalls to control how your resources communicate.

---

6. What is IAM, and why is it critical for security? Differentiate between an IAM User, Group, and Role.

IAM, or Identity and Access Management, is AWS’s central service for controlling who can access AWS resources and what actions they can perform.
It plays a critical role in cloud security because it enforces the principle of least privilege—meaning every user or service gets only the permissions they absolutely need and nothing more.

IAM protects your AWS environment from unauthorized access, accidental misuse, and security breaches by managing authentication and authorization across the entire account.

IAM defines three main identity types:

1. IAM User

An IAM User represents a real person or an application that requires long-term access.
Users have:

Long-term credentials, such as passwords or access keys

Specific permissions assigned directly or through groups

Example: A developer logging into the AWS console or a CI/CD system using access keys.

2. IAM Group

An IAM Group is a collection of users.
Instead of assigning permissions to each individual user, you assign them to a group.

This helps:

Manage permissions easily

Keep things consistent

Apply policies to multiple users at once

Example: A “Developers” group with read-only EC2 access.

3. IAM Role

An IAM Role is different from a user.
Roles do not have long-term credentials.
Instead, they provide temporary security credentials that AWS automatically rotates.

Roles are used by:

AWS services like EC2, Lambda

Users who need temporary elevated access

Cross-account access

Example: An EC2 instance assuming a role to read/write data to an S3 bucket without storing access keys inside the instance.

---

7. What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?

✅ Stopping vs. Terminating an EC2 Instance

An EC2 instance behaves like a virtual computer.
When you stop it, it’s like turning off your laptop.
When you terminate it, it’s like throwing your laptop away permanently.

🔹 1. Stopping an EC2 Instance (Temporary Shutdown)

Stopping means the instance is shut down but not deleted.

When you stop an instance:

The machine turns off, just like shutting down a computer

The root EBS volume stays attached
All data on the EBS volume is preserved
The instance can be started again anytime
No EC2 compute charges while stopped
EBS storage charges still apply (because your disk still exists)

Example:

You stop your EC2 instance overnight to save compute cost →
Next morning → You start it again and everything is exactly as before.

🔹 2. Terminating an EC2 Instance (Permanent Deletion)

Terminating means the instance is deleted forever.

When you terminate an instance:

The instance is completely removed
The root EBS volume is deleted by default
All data is lost unless you changed the setting to keep the volume
You cannot restart the instance again
All charges stop after termination (including compute and storage)

Example:
If you terminate an EC2 test environment → everything (instance + disk) is removed permanently.

---

8. ✅ What is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)?

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template that contains everything needed to launch an EC2 instance.

Think of an AMI as a blueprint or master image for creating virtual servers.

You can launch multiple EC2 instances from the same AMI, each having the same:

Operating system

Software

Configuration

🧩 Why is an AMI Important?

It allows AWS to:

Quickly launch consistent servers

Clone existing environments

Deploy scalable systems

Roll out updates or new versions easily

For example:
If you want 10 identical web servers → you launch them from the same AMI.

✅ What Does an AMI Contain? (3 Key Components)
1️⃣ Root Volume Template

This is the core part of an AMI.

It includes:

Operating System (Linux, Windows, Ubuntu, RHEL, etc.)

Application server (Apache, Nginx, Tomcat, etc.)

Any required software, dependencies, configurations

Basically, everything needed for an EC2 instance to boot and run.

2️⃣ Launch Permissions

These control who can use the AMI.

An AMI can be:

Private → only your AWS account can use it

Shared → specific AWS accounts can use it

Public → anyone on AWS can use it

This is useful when:

Companies share base images

Dev teams share custom AMIs

Public AMIs like Amazon Linux are shared by AWS

3️⃣ Block Device Mapping

This defines:

The root volume (EBS or Instance Store)

Any additional storage volumes to attach at launch

Example:

Root volume: 30GB EBS

Additional volume: 100GB EBS for logs

So, block device mapping tells EC2 what disks to attach and how to configure them.

🧠 Simple Analogy

An AMI is like a mobile phone backup.
When you restore from a backup:

All apps

Settings

OS version

Data
are restored exactly the same.

Same with AMI → It restores an EC2 instance in the same state.

⭐ In One Line:
An AMI is a complete server template—containing OS, software, permissions, and storage mappings—used to launch EC2 instances quickly and consistently.

---

9. ✅ What is the Purpose of Amazon CloudWatch?

Amazon CloudWatch is AWS’s monitoring and observability service.
Its main purpose is to help you:

Monitor your AWS resources and applications
Track performance and usage
Detect issues in real time
Get alerts when something goes wrong
Take automated actions to fix or respond to problems

CloudWatch gives you a complete operational view of your system, helping you keep applications healthy and optimized.

✅ Key Capabilities of CloudWatch (Explained Simply)

CloudWatch mainly works by collecting metrics, logs, events, and triggering alarms.

1️⃣ Metrics – Performance Measurements

Metrics are numeric values collected from AWS services and your own applications.

Examples of AWS metrics:

EC2: CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps
RDS: FreeStorageSpace
S3: NumberOfObjects

You can also send your own custom metrics, like:

RequestCount

ErrorRate

Number of active users

Metrics help you see how your system behaves over time.

2️⃣ Logs – Centralized Log Storage & Analysis

CloudWatch Logs collect log files from:

EC2 instances
Lambda functions
CloudTrail
Applications

You can:

Search logs for errors
Analyze patterns
Troubleshoot issues
Retain logs for compliance

It acts like one centralized place for all logs.

3️⃣ Alarms – Alerts & Automated Actions

CloudWatch Alarms let you set thresholds on any metric.

Examples:

If CPU goes above 80% → send an alert
If disk space is low → run a Lambda function
If a server is unhealthy → trigger Auto Scaling

Alarms can notify you through:

Email
SMS
SNS
Slack (via integration)

And can also automate actions like:

Stop/Start EC2 instances
Scale up/down Auto Scaling groups

---

10. ✅ Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling (Easy Explanation)

Scaling helps your application handle more traffic or workload.
There are two ways to scale: Vertical and Horizontal.

🔹 1️⃣ Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

Vertical scaling means increasing the power of a single server.

How?

Upgrade to a bigger EC2 instance

More CPU
More RAM
Faster disk

Example:
t2.micro → upgrade to → t2.large → upgrade to → m5.2xlarge

🔹 2️⃣ Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

Horizontal scaling means adding more servers instead of upgrading one.

How?

Add more EC2 instances
Put them behind a Load Balancer
Use Auto Scaling Groups to add/remove servers automatically

Example:
1 server → 3 servers → 10 servers → 100 servers

---

11. You need to provide an EC2 instance in a private subnet with access to the internet to download software patches. How would you achieve this securely?

💡 Problem

You have:

An EC2 instance in a private subnet (no public IP, no direct internet).

It needs internet access only for outbound traffic (like downloading patches, updates).

But you don’t want it exposed to the internet (no direct inbound traffic).

✅ Solution: Use a NAT Gateway in a Public Subnet

Create a NAT Gateway

Place it in a public subnet (a subnet that has a route to the Internet Gateway).

Attach an Elastic IP to the NAT Gateway.

This NAT device will act like a middleman for internet traffic.

Update Private Subnet Route Table

Go to the route table of the private subnet.

Add a route:

Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 (means “all internet traffic”)

Target: NAT Gateway

Now, whenever the EC2 instance in the private subnet wants to reach the internet, it will send traffic to the NAT Gateway.

How the Traffic Flows

EC2 (private IP) → sends request to NAT Gateway

NAT Gateway → replaces private IP with its public IP (Elastic IP) and forwards to the internet

Internet → sends response back to NAT’s public IP

NAT Gateway → maps it back to the original private IP of the EC2 and sends it into the VPC

✅ The key point:

Connections must start from inside (from the EC2).

Outside systems cannot directly start a connection to the private EC2, because it has no public IP and no direct route.

🔐 Why is this secure?

The EC2 instance is in a private subnet → no direct internet access, no public IP.

Only outbound connections are allowed via NAT.

Inbound connections from the internet are blocked by design, since:

There’s no route from Internet Gateway → private subnet.

NAT Gateway does not accept new connections initiated from outside.

🆚 Alternative: NAT Instance

You can also use a NAT Instance instead of a NAT Gateway:

It’s just an EC2 instance configured to act like NAT.

But:

You must patch, scale, manage it yourself.

Can be a single point of failure unless you handle HA.

NAT Gateway is managed, scalable, and more reliable, so it’s preferred in real projects and interviews.

🔁 How to say it in one interview-style answer

“I’ll keep the EC2 in a private subnet and give it outbound internet access using a NAT Gateway. I’ll place the NAT Gateway in a public subnet with an Elastic IP and update the private subnet’s route table to send 0.0.0.0/0 traffic to the NAT Gateway. This way, the instance can download patches from the internet, but no inbound connections from the internet can reach it directly, keeping it secure.”

12. ✅ Differences between S3, EBS, and EFS (Explained Clearly)
1. Amazon S3 – Object Storage

S3 stores data as objects (files + metadata) in buckets.
Accessible over HTTP/HTTPS, not mountable like a disk.
Designed for high durability (11 nines) and unlimited scalability.
You can store any amount of data, and S3 automatically manages redundancy.

Use Cases:

Backups and archives

Static website hosting (HTML, images, videos)

Big data / analytics / data lakes

Application logs

2. Amazon EBS – Block Storage

EBS provides block-level storage, like a virtual hard disk.

It attaches to a single EC2 instance at a time (except in multi-attach for specific volumes).

Supports low latency, high IOPS workloads.

Perfect for OS disks, databases, and transactional apps.

Data persists even if the EC2 instance stops.

Use Cases:

EC2 boot volume

Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Applications needing fast read/write performance

Any workload requiring block-level storage

3. Amazon EFS – File Storage

EFS is a fully managed NFS file system.

It can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances at the same time.

Automatically scales storage capacity as files are added.

Great for shared workloads and multi-server architectures.

---

13. When would you choose a relational database like Amazon RDS versus a NoSQL database like DynamoDB?

“I would choose Amazon RDS when the application needs structured relational data, ACID transactions, and complex SQL queries—such as e-commerce, financial systems, or CRM applications.

I’d use DynamoDB when I need high scalability, low latency, and flexible schema for workloads with simple key-value or document access patterns—such as user profiles, IoT data, gaming apps, or session management.”

---

14. ✅ What is an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?

An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is an AWS-managed service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets such as EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda functions.

It improves:

Availability → spreads traffic across healthy targets

Fault tolerance → avoids overloaded or unhealthy instances

Scalability → handles varying traffic automatically

ELB also performs health checks, so it only sends traffic to healthy resources.

🚀 Types of Load Balancers in AWS

1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).

Understands application-level content.

Supports content-based routing:

URL path–based routing (e.g., /api, /images)

Host-based routing (e.g., app.example.com, api.example.com)

Header-based routing

Ideal for microservices, containers, and serverless architectures.

Use Cases:

Web applications

Microservices behind Amazon ECS/EKS

Routing traffic to multiple backends

2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Works at Layer 4 (TCP, UDP, TLS).

Extremely fast—handles millions of requests per second.

Has static IP addresses and supports Elastic IPs.

Very low latency suitable for real-time workloads.

Use Cases:

High-performance, low-latency applications

Gaming, IoT, streaming

Load balancing TCP/UDP traffic

---

15. ✅ What is an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)?

An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is an AWS service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your application based on demand.
It ensures:

You have enough instances during high traffic

You save cost by reducing instances during low demand

Your application remains fault-tolerant (replaces unhealthy instances automatically)

In simple words:
ASG = automatic capacity management + cost optimization + high availability.

🔧 Key Components Needed to Configure an ASG

1. Launch Template / Launch Configuration

This defines how your EC2 instances should look.
It includes:

AMI (OS image)

Instance type

Security groups

Key pair

User data script

IAM role

This acts as a blueprint for launching new instances.

2. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Settings

The ASG itself defines:

Minimum capacity (minimum number of instances always running)

Maximum capacity (hard limit of instances)

Desired capacity (initial number of instances)

VPC subnets where instances will launch

Health checks (EC2 or ELB)

The ASG ensures that the desired and minimum number of instances are always maintained.

3. Scaling Policies (How ASG decides to scale)

ASG can scale using 3 policy types:

a. Target Tracking Scaling (most common)

You set a target metric (e.g., maintain CPU at 50%).
ASG automatically scales up/down to keep that target level.

b. Step or Simple Scaling

Triggered by CloudWatch alarms.
Example:

If CPU > 70% for 5 mins → add 2 instances

If CPU < 30% for 10 mins → remove 1 instance

c. Scheduled Scaling

Used when traffic is predictable.
Example:

Scale up at 9 AM

Scale down at 10 PM

🎯 Interview-Friendly Summary

“An Auto Scaling Group automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on demand, helping maintain performance and reduce costs. To configure an ASG, you need a Launch Template or Launch Configuration that defines the instance settings, an Auto Scaling Group that defines the min/max/desired capacity and subnet placement, and scaling policies—such as target tracking, step scaling, or scheduled scaling—to control how and when the ASG scales.”

---

16. ✅ What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a DevOps practice where you manage and provision infrastructure using code instead of manual steps.

👉 Instead of:

Logging into AWS console

Clicking to create VPCs, subnets, EC2s, security groups

You write code (YAML, JSON, Terraform, etc.) that describes the infrastructure.
⭐ Why does IaC matter?

IaC allows teams to:

Automate infrastructure creation

Avoid manual mistakes

Maintain consistency across environments (dev/stage/prod)

Version control infrastructure (store in Git like normal code)

Reproduce environments anytime

It makes infrastructure management faster, reliable, and scalable.

✅ What is AWS CloudFormation?

AWS CloudFormation is Amazon’s native IaC service.
It lets you define AWS resources using templates (YAML or JSON) and deploy them as stacks.

⭐ Role of CloudFormation

CloudFormation helps you:

1. Model and Provision Resources

Create entire environments with a single template:

VPC

Subnets

Route tables

EC2

RDS database

IAM roles

All generated automatically.

2. Automation & Consistency

Using CloudFormation:

Same template = same environment

No human errors

Dev, Stage, Prod can be identical

Full environment spins up in minutes

3. Version Control

CloudFormation templates are code, so you can:

Store in Git

Review changes

Track diffs

Rollback to previous versions

4. Repeatability & Disaster Recovery

You can recreate the same infrastructure in:

Another AWS region

Another AWS account

A DR site

Just by re-running the template.

📌 Final, Simple Summary

IaC:
Using code to create/manage infrastructure instead of doing it manually.

CloudFormation:
AWS service that lets you write templates (YAML/JSON) to automatically create and manage AWS resources in a consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled way.

---

17. ✅ S3 Storage Classes (Explained Simply)

Amazon S3 provides different storage classes depending on how often you access data and how much you want to pay.
Each class balances cost, durability, and availability.

🔹 1. S3 Standard

Used for frequently accessed data

High performance

99.99% availability

Ideal for: websites, mobile apps, backups, big data analytics

✔ Most expensive among general-purpose classes, but fastest.

🔹 2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Automatically moves your data between:

Frequent access

Infrequent access

Archive tiers

Based on how often you access the object

No operational overhead, no performance loss

✔ Best when access patterns are unknown or unpredictable.

🔹 3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

For rarely accessed data

Cheaper storage but higher retrieval cost

Ideal for: backups, disaster recovery copies

🔹 4. S3 One Zone-IA

Same as Standard-IA, but stored in one Availability Zone instead of three

Cheaper, but less resilient

Good for non-critical data or secondary backups

🔹 5. S3 Glacier Classes (Archival Storage)

Used for long-term data archiving, extremely low cost.

a) Glacier Instant Retrieval

Milliseconds retrieval

Cheaper than Standard-IA

For archival data that may be accessed occasionally

b) Glacier Flexible Retrieval

Retrieval time: minutes to hours

Suitable for backups or archive with occasional restores

c) Glacier Deep Archive

Cheapest S3 storage

Retrieval time: 12 hours or more

Used for regulatory data, long-term retention (7–10 years)

✅ Purpose of S3 Lifecycle Policies

S3 Lifecycle Policies help automate storage cost optimization.

They define rules that move objects between storage classes or delete them after a defined time.

⭐ What Lifecycle Policies Do:

1. Transition Objects

Automatically move objects to cheaper storage classes:

Example:

After 30 days → move to Standard-IA

After 90 days → move to Glacier

After 1 year → move to Glacier Deep Archive

✔ Helps reduce cost automatically.

2. Expire (Delete) Objects

Delete objects after a set time:

Example:

Delete logs after 60 days

Delete temporary files after 7 days

✔ Helps meet compliance, reduces clutter, lowers cost.

📌 Simple Summary
S3 Storage Classes

Different pricing tiers based on:

How often you access data

How fast you need it

How long you want to store it

How much durability you require

S3 Lifecycle Policies

Automate:

Moving data to cheaper storage

Deleting old objects

---

18. ✅ Difference Between Elastic IP and Public IP in AWS

Both Public IP and Elastic IP (EIP) allow an EC2 instance to be reachable from the internet.
However, they behave very differently in terms of lifecycle, ownership, and stability.

🔹 1. Public IP Address

A Public IP is:

Automatically assigned when you launch an instance in a public subnet

Temporary

Changes whenever you stop/start the instance

Released automatically when the instance is terminated

Cannot be moved to another instance

Not suitable for production endpoints where the IP must stay fixed

👉 Use-case:

Short-lived workloads, dev/testing systems that don’t require a fixed IP.

🔹 2. Elastic IP Address (EIP)

An Elastic IP is:

A static IPv4 address you own in your AWS account

Does not change even if the instance stops/starts

Can be attached or detached from EC2 instances or ENIs

Allows quick failover — move the same IP to another instance during failure

Suitable for production systems, DNS, and stable endpoints

AWS charges for unused Elastic IPs to avoid hoarding.

👉 Use-case:

Production servers, ALB alternatives, legacy apps requiring a fixed IP.

---

19. ✅ 20. What is the purpose of AWS Lambda? Compare it to EC2.
    🔹 What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service where you run your code without managing servers.

You just:

Upload your code

Lambda runs it only when needed

You pay only for the compute time used (per millisecond)

⭐ Key purposes of Lambda:

Run event-driven applications (S3 uploads, DynamoDB changes, API Gateway requests, etc.)

Automate backend tasks

Build serverless APIs

Run scheduled jobs (cron-like tasks)

Process streams/logs in real-time (Kinesis, CloudWatch)

You never manage:

OS

Servers

Patching

Scaling

Everything is auto-handled by AWS.

🔹 AWS Lambda vs EC2 — Simple Comparison
Feature AWS Lambda Amazon EC2
Server management No servers (fully managed) You manage servers, OS, patches
Pricing Pay per request + execution time Pay per hour/second while instance runs
Scaling Auto-scales instantly Manual or auto-scaling group needed
Run duration Max 15 minutes per execution No time limit
Use cases Short tasks, event-driven apps Long-running apps, full control
Startup Cold start sometimes Always running
Maintenance None You maintain infrastructure
Control level Low-level control not allowed Full control (SSH access, root access)
✅ When to Use Lambda

Microservices

APIs

Event-based workflows

File processing (images, video)

Cron jobs

Lightweight backend tasks

✅ When to Use EC2

Applications needing full control over OS

Long-running processes (e.g., web servers, game servers)

Applications requiring persistent connections

Custom networking, security agents, software installations

Heavy workloads not suitable for 15-minute Lambda limit

⭐ Simple Summary

Lambda: Run code without servers, automatically scales, pay only when used. Best for short, event-driven workloads.

EC2: Virtual machine where you control everything. Best for long-running, stable workloads requiring full customization.

---

20. ✅ Goal: Design a Serverless API Backend on AWS

“Serverless” means:

You don’t manage servers or OS

AWS manages scaling, availability, and infrastructure

You focus mainly on business logic

Your main building blocks:

API Gateway → Entry point (HTTP/REST API)

Auth (Cognito / Lambda Authorizer) → Who is calling?

Lambda → Backend functions (business logic)

DynamoDB → Database (NoSQL)

CloudWatch + IaC (SAM/CloudFormation) → Monitoring + deployments

🔹 1. API Gateway – Front Door of the API

Exposes REST/HTTP endpoints like:

POST /login
GET /users
POST /orders

Handles:

Routing → which Lambda to call

Rate limiting / throttling

Authorization integration (Cognito / Lambda Authorizers)

Optional request/response validation (schemas)

Think of it as the “API layer”.

🔹 2. Authentication & Authorization
🧩 Amazon Cognito

Used for user sign-up, sign-in, and tokens (JWTs).
Users log in → Cognito gives them a JWT access token.
API Gateway verifies this token before calling Lambda.

🧩 Lambda Authorizer (optional)

A custom Lambda function used by API Gateway to:

Validate custom tokens

Validate API keys

Integrate with third-party auth providers

So:

Cognito → built-in user pool and JWT auth.

Lambda Authorizer → more complex or custom auth logic.

🔹 3. AWS Lambda – Business Logic

Each API endpoint (like GET /orders) calls a Lambda function.

Lambda:

Parses request from API Gateway

Validates input

Reads/writes data to DynamoDB

Returns a response (JSON) back to API Gateway

Features:

Auto-scaling

Pay-per-use (only when invoked)

No server management

🔹 4. DynamoDB – Database Layer

Fully-managed NoSQL database.

Great for:

High performance, low-latency reads/writes

Serverless apps (no server to manage)

Lambda uses the AWS SDK to:

PutItem → Insert data

GetItem / Query → Read data

UpdateItem → Update data

You design tables and partition keys based on access patterns.

🔹 5. Monitoring & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
📊 CloudWatch

Lambda logs → print()/console.log go to CloudWatch Logs.

You can see:

Errors
Latency
Invocations
Throttles

📦 SAM / CloudFormation

You define your whole architecture as code:

API Gateway endpoints
Lambda functions
DynamoDB tables
IAM roles

Benefits:

Version-controlled

Easy to recreate environments (dev, test, prod)

Automated deployments (CI/CD)

🔁 End-to-End Flow (Simple Story)

Client (web/mobile) calls GET /orders with a JWT token.
API Gateway receives the request.

API Gateway:

Validates token using Cognito or Lambda Authorizer.
Routes the request to the correct Lambda function.

Lambda:

Reads the request parameters
Fetches data from DynamoDB
Returns a JSON response.
API Gateway sends the response back to the client.
All logs & metrics go to CloudWatch.

21. ✅ What is ECS in AWS?

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by AWS.
It helps you run and manage Docker containers at scale without having to install or operate container orchestration software yourself.

Think of ECS as the AWS tool that:

Runs your containers
Starts/stops them automatically
Handles scaling
Connects containers to networks, load balancers, and IAM roles

🔹 Key Features of ECS

1. Fully managed

AWS handles:

Infrastructure management

Scheduling containers

Scaling

Health checks

You just define how your app should run.

2. Works with EC2 or Fargate

You can choose:

ECS on EC2

You manage the EC2 servers that run containers.

ECS on Fargate

No servers at all; AWS runs containers for you.

Serverless container compute.

3. Deep AWS Integration

ECS integrates tightly with:

IAM

VPC & subnets

CloudWatch

Application Load Balancer

ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

This makes deployments smooth and secure.

4. No control plane to manage

You don’t manage Kubernetes masters or cluster control planes (unlike EKS).
AWS handles everything behind the scenes.

🔹 Where ECS Is Used

Running microservices

Hosting backend APIs

Batch processing jobs

Containerizing old monolithic apps

Running scalable web services

🔹 Why Choose ECS?

You choose ECS when you want:

Simpler container orchestration

Lower operational overhead

AWS-native solution

Fast setup

Less complexity compared to Kubernetes (EKS)

⭐ Simple Explanation (One Line)

ECS is AWS’s fully managed service for running Docker containers without needing to manage your own orchestration platform.

22. How would you design a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture for a critical web application on AWS?

✅ Goal: Highly Available & Fault-Tolerant Web App on AWS

Idea:
Don’t depend on any single server, single AZ, or single DB instance.
If one thing fails, traffic should automatically move to healthy resources without downtime (or with very minimal impact).

Your design has 3 main layers:

Load Balancer (ALB)

Web/App Tier (EC2 + Auto Scaling Group)

Database Tier (RDS Multi-AZ)

Let’s break them down.

🔹 1. Load Balancer (ALB)

What it does:

Sits in front of your EC2 instances.

Receives all incoming traffic (HTTP/HTTPS).

Distributes requests across instances in multiple AZs.

Key features:

Multi-AZ: ALB has nodes in more than one AZ. If one AZ LB node fails, others still serve traffic.

Health checks: Regularly checks if EC2 instances are healthy.

If an instance fails → ALB stops sending traffic to it.

Path-based & host-based routing:

/api/\* → API service target group

/images/\* → image service target group

admin.example.com → admin backend

👉 Result: No single instance or AZ is a bottleneck at the entry point.

🔹 2. Web/App Tier – EC2 with Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

What you’re doing:

Run your web/app servers (EC2) in an Auto Scaling Group.

Spread instances across at least 2 Availability Zones.

Benefits:

High Availability:

If one AZ goes down, instances in the other AZ still serve traffic.

Fault Tolerance:

If an instance becomes unhealthy, ASG terminates and replaces it automatically.

Auto Scaling:

Scale out (add instances) on high load (CPU, requests).

Scale in when traffic drops, saving cost.

👉 Result: The app layer survives instance failures and even full AZ failures.

🔹 3. Database Tier – RDS Multi-AZ

What RDS Multi-AZ gives you:

You have:

Primary DB instance in one AZ

Synchronous standby replica in another AZ

Writes are synchronously replicated:

Data is safely stored in both AZs.

Failover behavior:

If the primary DB fails (instance, AZ, hardware):

RDS automatically promotes the standby to primary.

Uses the same DB endpoint (hostname).

App usually needs no configuration change – reconnects to the same endpoint.

Benefits:

High durability: data is stored across AZs.

Minimal downtime during DB failures.

👉 Result: Your database is resilient to instance and AZ failures.

🔁 Putting It All Together – Request Flow

User hits https://yourapp.com.

Route 53 (optional but common) sends traffic to the ALB.

ALB distributes requests to healthy EC2 instances in multiple AZs (via ASG).

EC2 instances access RDS Multi-AZ for data.

If:

An instance dies → ALB stops sending traffic; ASG replaces it.
An AZ dies → ALB routes traffic only to the healthy AZ.
DB primary fails → RDS fails over to standby with same endpoint.
Your app stays online (or suffers only minimal interruption).

⭐ One-Line Interview Summary

“I’ll design the web app using an ALB in multi-AZ, an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances across at least two AZs, and an RDS Multi-AZ database. This removes single points of failure at the load balancer, app, and database layers, giving high availability and fault tolerance.”
